# Baby Cry Analyzer - Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Baby Cry Analyzer! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd baby_cry_analyzer

# Run the setup script
python setup.py
```

### 2. Generate Sample Data (for testing)
```bash
# Generate synthetic audio samples for testing
python generate_samples.py --samples 10

# Or generate a single test file
python generate_samples.py --test-file test_cry.wav --type hungry
```

### 3. Train the Model
```bash
# Train the machine learning model
python train_model.py
```

### Understanding Training Results
After training, you'll see results like this:
```
Training Accuracy: 0.9609 (96%)
Validation Accuracy: 0.3333 (33%)
Cross-validation Score: 0.4375 (+/- 0.1133)
```

**What these numbers mean:**
- üö® **High Training Accuracy + Low Validation Accuracy = Overfitting**
- ‚úÖ **Good signs**: 161 files processed, all 5 categories present
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning signs**: Large gap between training (96%) and validation (33%)

**Quick fixes for your results:**
```bash
# 1. Add more data (recommended: 50+ samples per category)
python generate_samples.py --samples 30

# 2. Reduce model complexity
# Edit model.py and change n_estimators from 100 to 50

# 3. Retrain with more data
python train_model.py
```

### 4. Start the API Server
```bash
# Start the web API
python app.py
```

### 5. Test the System
```bash
# Test the API (in another terminal)
python test_api.py --audio test_cry.wav

# Or visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser
```

## üìÅ Using Your Own Audio Data

### Directory Structure
Place your .wav files in the appropriate category folders:
```
dataset/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hungry/          # Baby is hungry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pain/            # Baby is in pain/discomfort
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ need_to_change/  # Baby needs diaper change
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tired/           # Baby is tired/sleepy
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ attention/       # Baby wants attention
```

### Audio Requirements
- Format: WAV files only
- Duration: 0.5 - 10 seconds
- Sample rate: Minimum 8kHz (22kHz recommended)
- Quality: Clear audio with minimal background noise

### Data Collection Tips
- Record at least 20 samples per category for good results
- Ensure variety in recordings (different times, conditions)
- Label categories accurately
- Keep consistent recording quality

## üîß API Usage

### Upload and Analyze Audio
```bash
curl -X POST -F "audio=@baby_cry.wav" http://localhost:5000/predict
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "prediction": {
    "predicted_need": "hungry",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "description": "Baby needs feeding",
    "recommendations": [
      "Check if it's feeding time",
      "Prepare a bottle or breastfeed",
      "Try offering food if baby is old enough for solids"
    ]
  },
  "all_probabilities": {
    "hungry": 0.85,
    "tired": 0.08,
    "attention": 0.04,
    "pain": 0.02,
    "need_to_change": 0.01
  }
}
```

## üß† Understanding the Results

### Confidence Scores
- **0.8-1.0**: High confidence - Very reliable prediction
- **0.6-0.8**: Medium confidence - Generally reliable
- **0.4-0.6**: Low confidence - Use with caution
- **0.0-0.4**: Very low confidence - Prediction may be unreliable

### Categories Explained

| Category | Description | Common Signs |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Hungry** | Baby needs feeding | Rhythmic crying, rooting, lip smacking |
| **Pain** | Physical discomfort | High-pitched, intense, sudden onset |
| **Need to Change** | Diaper needs changing | Fussing after feeding/sleeping |
| **Tired** | Baby is sleepy | Rubbing eyes, yawning, grizzling |
| **Attention** | Wants comfort/interaction | Stops when picked up, varied intensity |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Model Types
The system supports two model types:
- **Random Forest** (default): Fast, interpretable, good for small datasets
- **SVM**: More accurate with larger datasets, slower training

### Customizing Audio Processing
Edit `audio_processor.py` to modify:
- Feature extraction parameters
- Audio preprocessing steps
- Sample rate and duration settings

### Performance Tuning
1. **More Data**: Add more audio samples per category
2. **Data Quality**: Ensure consistent, high-quality recordings
3. **Feature Engineering**: Modify feature extraction in `audio_processor.py`
4. **Model Tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters in `model.py`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'librosa'"**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"Model not loaded"**
- Train a model first: `python train_model.py`
- Check if model files exist in `models/` directory

**"No audio files found"**
- Add .wav files to `dataset/<category>/` folders
- Check file permissions and formats

**Low accuracy**
- Add more training data (20+ samples per category)
- Improve audio quality and labeling
- Ensure balanced dataset across categories

### Performance Issues

**Slow API responses**
- Use smaller audio files (< 5 seconds)
- Consider using Random Forest instead of SVM
- Check system resources (RAM, CPU)

**High memory usage**
- Reduce audio duration in config
- Use lower sample rates for processing
- Clear uploads folder regularly

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

### View Training Reports
Check the `reports/` directory for:
- Training accuracy metrics
- Confusion matrices
- Feature importance plots

### API Usage Logs
Prediction logs are saved to `logs/predictions.jsonl`

### Analyze Performance
```bash
python -c "from utils import analyze_prediction_logs; print(analyze_prediction_logs())"
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### For Production Use
- Add authentication to API endpoints
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate file uploads thoroughly
- Use HTTPS for data transmission
- Consider data privacy regulations

### File Upload Security
- The system only accepts .wav files
- Files are automatically deleted after processing
- Maximum file size is limited to 16MB

## üÜò Getting Help

1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Review the log files in `logs/` directory
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Verify your audio files meet the requirements

## üéØ Next Steps

Once you have the basic system working:

1. **Collect Real Data**: Replace synthetic samples with real baby cry recordings
2. **Improve Model**: Experiment with different algorithms and parameters
3. **Add Features**: Implement additional audio features or preprocessing
4. **Deploy**: Set up the system for production use
5. **Monitor**: Track prediction accuracy and system performance
